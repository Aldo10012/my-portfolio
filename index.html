                        <strong>High School</strong><br>
                        I graduated from Skiline High School in May of 2020 in the top 10 of my calss. I took a total of 9 AP classes and 4 College classes. <br>
                        In addition to my crazy class schedule, I led the YoungLife club, competed in the Chess club, danced in the "La Raza" club, and was commander of my schools JROTC program. I also attended varius programs outside of school such as Code Next, Blue Stapm Engineering, and Element.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>College</strong><br>
                        Currently, I am a student at Make School studying commputer science. My hope is that I walk away with teh skills and abilities to, not just find a secure job, but to use my skills and craft to make an impact in the world.
